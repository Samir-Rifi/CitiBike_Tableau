#### 7.2. Analysis:
o	The usage increases significantly on the 2 last days of the week for both males and females with a significant drop on Wednesday.
o	Subscribers will be using bike sharing services more during weekdays than on weekends while it is the opposite for the other customers.

## SUMMARY:

o	From the analysis above we can come to the conclusion that most bike sharing service users are subscribers that use bikes during weekdays and for short rides (less than 10 minutes with peak happening at 5 minutes).
	This high usage frequency coupled with short usage time will result on high service level, since there will always be a high number of bikes available for users at all times and will certainly maximize the profit since this will retain subscribers and attract occasional users.

o	To give further depth to the analysis, we can couple demographics with geographic data to know for example the average age of users travelling a given circuit and using specific stations.
o	We can also add “places of interest” as an additional station attribute to predict the users’ profile in a given area. For example, if a station is close to a campus, the odds that users 18-24 years old would be heavy users while for stations that are close to offices, users will be more looking toward 25-40 years old.
	This information will help customize subscription plans according to each group’s needs and income.
